Of course, it is well correlated with Public Transport as to facilitate the access to the public and increase customer rate. On the other hand, Crime rate should be low (as we can see here it is negatively correlated to the number of fast-food) as the clients should feel safe when coming to the restaurants. However, we would have expected that it would be positively correlated with Childhood Obesity and Unemployment rate. We think that as fast-food are cheap, the chains won't target the fancy social class but mostly the ones that need comfort foods.

A high Nutripoint doesn't necessary mean that all the consumers of this area consume more fatty or sugary products. Furthermore, an unhealthy average product is not linked to a high number of fast-foods. However, it could be interesting to see if the richest areas have less fast-foods making the assumption that the inhabitants would prefer to go in a real restaurant.  "
